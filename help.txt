1. make sure that xdg.nix is imported for hyprland screenshot script, needs $XDG_SCREENSHOT_DIR set in xdg.nix
2. for rbw (bitwarden alternate cli), use `rbw register` with api keys (https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/)
3. for bitwarden-cli, run `bw login` to setup
4. for bitwarden-desktop, change the theme to "dark" (unable to change through .config, as data.json is massive)
