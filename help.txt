1. copy generated hardware-configuration.nix to the hosts (cp -r /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix /path/to/flake/hosts/muse/hardware-configuration.nix)
2. make sure that xdg.nix is imported for hyprland screenshot script, needs $XDG_SCREENSHOT_DIR set in xdg.nix
3?. for rbw (bitwarden alternate cli), use `rbw register` with api keys (https://bitwarden.com/help/personal-api-key/)
note: broken right now, wait for pr to merge for nixos package
4. for bitwarden-cli, run `bw login` to setup
5. for bitwarden-desktop, change the theme to "dark" (unable to change through .config, as data.json is massive)
6. for thunderbird, set theme and login to accounts manually
7. for rstudio, set the theme and setting
8. add ssh keys and login w/gh cli for more git stuff
9?. check to see if catppuccin/gtk is fixed for nixos (current version just leads to default light theme, using adwaita-dark for now)
10. for discord: because openasar is being used, every update we need to disable openasar, launch discord to allow for file generation, then reenable openasar
